            Learning a new cuisine is a lot like learning a new language. With a language, there's a grammar and vocabulary that together allow you to form sentences and express yourself. With a cuisine, there's a body of techniques that function much like a grammar. When they're combined with the cuisine's "vocabulary" of ingredients, dishes and meals can be made. Learning this grammar and vocabulary is the first step toward fluency—the ability to think and cook like a native.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge for those of us seeking to understand the "language" of a cuisine is figuring out where to start. Cooking classes are a great way to get some hands-on experience, but unless you enroll in a school full time, you're unlikely to get more than a quick tour of a few recipes—the culinary equivalent of memorizing a handful of useful expressions from a phrasebook. You may be able to ask where the bathroom is, but you also may not understand the answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Books are some of the best resources, of course, but there are so many, each loaded with dozens of recipes, that perusing them can quickly start to feel daunting. What's needed is a road map of sorts, to help home cooks explore the most essential elements of a cuisine. That's what this is, for Italian food. Cook your way through the recipes below and read the supporting articles, and you'll have a good base from which to dig deeper.
